                Optifusion Technologies provides professional recruitment consultancy
                and talent acquisition solutions, including candidate sourcing,
                screening, shortlisting, interview coordination, and talent reporting.

                Optifusion Technologies does not charge any fees from candidates or job
                seekers. All payments are made solely by client organizations using our
                services.
              </p>
              <p>
                Clients may subscribe to service plans (Monthly, Quarterly, or Annual)
                as published on our website or provided via proposal or invoice. Each
                plan outlines the scope, limits, and recruiter support provided.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700">3. Payments and Refunds</h2>
            <div className="mt-3 space-y-3">
              <p>
                All payments must be made in advance before service commencement.
                Accepted payment methods include UPI and Bank Transfer. An official
                invoice shall be issued for every transaction. Services commence only
                after full payment confirmation.
              </p>
              <p>
                If no hiring is completed during the subscription period, the client may
                request a refund. If partial hiring has been done, Optifusion
                Technologies shall deduct a proportional service charge based on the
                number of successful hires before processing the refund. Refunds, if
                approved, shall be processed within fourteen (14) business days of
                written confirmation from both parties.
              </p>
              <p>
                In case of non-payment, delayed payment, or payment reversal,

            <div className="mt-3 space-y-3">
              <p>
                Once a candidate provided by Optifusion Technologies is hired by the
                Client, the Client must notify the Company within forty-eight (48) hours
                of selection.
              </p>
              <p>
                Optifusion Technologies offers a fifteen (15)-day replacement period for
                hired candidates. If a candidate resigns or is terminated within 15
                days, a replacement candidate shall be provided at no additional cost.
              </p>
              <p>
                The replacement policy does not apply if the Client changes the job
                profile or salary range, terminates employment for reasons unrelated to
                performance, or delays interviews beyond agreed timelines.

              </p>
              <p>
                Clients are prohibited from directly approaching or hiring candidates
                introduced by Optifusion Technologies outside the contractual scope,
